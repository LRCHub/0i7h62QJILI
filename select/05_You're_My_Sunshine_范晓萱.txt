You are my sunshine my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
Youll never know dear how much I love you
Pleaes dont take my sunshine away
You are my sunshine my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
Youll never know dear how much I love you
Pleaes dont take my sunshine away
Pleaes dont take my sunshine away
终
